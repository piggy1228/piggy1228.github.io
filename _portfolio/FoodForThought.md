* Developed a webpage which recommends Airbnb homes in NYC to users based on their food preference and food options in the neighborhoods, with data from Airbnb and Yelp, stored on
cloud hosting (AWS)
* Users are able to customize their home preferences, including price range and choice of neighbor-
hood
* Results are shown on Google Maps, where users are able to be directed to webpages of the Airbnb
homes, as well as nearby restaurants. Altogether, users can integrate food and homes into plans,
and bookmark them in their accounts
