* Built a cloud platform with its webmail and storage service, analogous to Gmail and Google Drive.
* A set of frontend servers can be accessed with browsers and users are able to interact with the services
* A distributed storage system in the backend, home to storage of all state and key-value store abstractions, is built to guarantee the consistency of storage by achieving load balancing and fault tolerance
