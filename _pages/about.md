Hello there! My name is Zhilin Han. Welcome to my website!

If you are looking for a short bio, I originally from [<span class="underline-on-hover" style="color:#0000FF">Harbin, China</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin). In 2014, I went to [<span class="underline-on-hover" style="color:#0000FF">China University of Geosciences</span>](http://www.cugb.edu.cn/index.action) pursuing a Bachelor's degree of Science in Geographic Information Science. I then, in 2016, transferred to [<span class="underline-on-hover" style="color:#0000FF">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</span>](http://www.rpi.edu/) and changed my major to Computer Science. Currently, I'm a senior and looking forward to pursuing a Master's degree from Fall 2019.

For more information, click [<span class="underline-on-hover" style="color:#0000FF">here</span>](/resume) to see my resume.
