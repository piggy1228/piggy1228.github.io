Hello there! My name is Kexin(Kathy) Zhu. Welcome to my website!


I recently graduated from [<span class="underline-on-hover" style="color:#0000FF">University of Pennsylvania</span>](https://www.upenn.edu/) with my master degree in Computer & Information Science.
I interned at [<span class="underline-on-hover" style="color:#0000FF">Twitch</span>](https://www.twitch.tv/) as a software engineer intern in 2019 summer.
I graduated from [<span class="underline-on-hover" style="color:#0000FF">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</span>](http://www.rpi.edu/) with my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics in 2018. 

I am interested in distributed systems, operating systems and networks. Also I am eager to learn more areas I am not familiar yet. 

Pursue excellence and success will follow.
